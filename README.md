# CameraMotionSensing
This is a university project at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. This project will require the use of python and it's OpenCV libraries to capture and analyse the video feed. After motion has been sensed 5 snapshots would be taken after every 5 seconds. 

When the code senses any unusual movements then 5 snapshots of the video feed is taken at an interval of 5 seconds each.
Each picture will be saved by the name of date_of_picture_taken and time_of_picture taken.
